        "Last week, we were introduced to the notion of data types. Recall that \"data type\" can be thought of as the category (or type) of data i.e. integer, float, character, etc.\n",

        "## Lists\n",
        "\n",
        "Perhaps the most fundamental data structure in Python is that of a **list**. Just like lists in real life or in mathematics, Python lists are just collections of items enclosed in square brackets:\n",

        "[<item 1>, <item 2>, ..., <item n>]\n",
