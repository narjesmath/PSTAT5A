**Welcome to the first PSTAT 5A Lab!** As we will soon learn, computers play an integral part in effectively and efficiently performing statistical analyses. The primary goal of these Labs is to develop the skills to communicate with computers and learn the basic principles and language of programming.

This first lab will introduce you to the JupyterHub environment, Python as a programming language, and some basic concepts of programming. You will also complete a series of tasks to familiarize yourself with the tools and concepts we will use throughout the course.

This lab is designed to be completed during your first lab section of the week, and it will set the foundation for the rest of the course. Make sure to read through all the material carefully, as it will be essential for your success in PSTAT 5A.

---

## Structure of Labs

Every week we (the course staff) will publish a lab document, which is intended to be completed during your Lab Section (i.e., your first Section) of the week. Each lab document will consist of a combination of text, tips, and the occasional task for you to complete based on the text provided. Your TA will cover exactly what you need to turn in at the end of each lab in order to receive credit, but you should read all lab material carefully and thoroughly as content from labs will appear on quizzes and exams.

## What Is Programming?

Computers, though incredibly useful, are fairly complex machines. To communicate with them, we need to use a specific language, known as a **programming language**. There are a number of programming languages currently in use—R, Julia, MatLab, and the language we will use for this course, **Python**.

Python programs can be written in many environments (e.g., text editors like VS Code or in a Terminal window). For this class we will use **Jupyter Notebook** (pronounced "Jew-pi-ter"), an interactive environment that's hosted online so you don't have to install anything to run Python code!

---

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to **[https://pstat5a.lsit.ucsb.edu](https://pstat5a.lsit.ucsb.edu/hub/login)**   
   - If you are using a personal computer, you may want to bookmark this page for easy access later.

2. Click **Sign in with your UCSB NetID**, and sign in.

## The JupyterHub Environment

Jupyter notebooks are built from **cells**—the shaded boxes you see on screen. Here's how to work with them:

### Cell Activation

- **Inactive cell**  
  - Appearance: light grey background  
  - Action: click anywhere inside the cell to activate  
  ![](/files/labs/lab1/img/cell_color.png){width=400px}

- **Active cell**  
  - Appearance: colored border (green or blue)  
  - You can now type code or Markdown here.   

::: {.callout-tip}
Only the **active** cell runs when you press Run.
:::

### Running Cells

- Click the ▶️ **Run** button in the toolbar  
- Or press **Shift + Enter** to run and advance to the next cell  
![](/files/labs/lab1/img/run_button.png){width=400px}

---

## Cell Types

You can switch any cell between **Code** and **Markdown**:

### Code Cells

- **Purpose:** write and execute Python code  
- **Select:**  
  1. Click the cell  
  2. Choose **Code** from the toolbar dropdown  
     ![](/files/labs/lab1/img/change_cell_type.png){width=400px}  
- **Run:** ▶️ Run button or **Shift + Enter**  

### Markdown Cells

- **Purpose:** write formatted text, headings, lists, math, and embed images  
- **Select:**  
  1. Click the cell  
  2. Choose **Markdown** from the toolbar dropdown  
     ![](/files/labs/lab1/img/markdown_cell.png){width=400px} 
- **Render:** ▶️ Run button or **Shift + Enter**  

---

## Task 2: Markdown and Code Cells

::: {.task-box}
1. Click into the initial cell (marked by `[ ]` on the left).  
2. In the toolbar dropdown (that currently says **Code**), select **Markdown**.  
3. Copy-paste the following (including the `#`):

   ```markdown
   # Task 2
   ```

4. Run the cell. You should see a large heading that says "Task 2".
5. Add a new cell below (use the + button or menu).
6. Make sure the new cell is a **Code** cell.
7. Enter the following code and run it:

   ```python
   2 + 2
   ```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```
:::

---

## Task 3: Understanding Errors

::: {.task-box}
1. Add a new Markdown cell with the heading:

   ```markdown
   # Task 3
   ```

2. Add a new Code cell and enter the following (intentional error):

   ```python
   2 plus 2
   ```

3. Run the cell. You should see an error message like:

```
  Cell In[2], line 1
    2 plus 2
      ^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

**Explanation:**
- Python doesn't understand `plus` as an operator
- The `^^^^` points to where Python detected the problem
- The error message tells us it's a `SyntaxError` meaning invalid Python syntax
- In Python, we must use `+` for addition, not the word `plus`

4. Correct the code to:

   ```python
   2 + 2  # This works correctly
   ```

5. Run the corrected cell. You should see:
```
4
```
:::

## Task 4: Math in Python

::: {.task-box}
1. In a new Code cell, compute the following:

   $\frac{2 + 3}{4 + 5^6}$

   ```python
   (2 + 3) / (4 + 5**6)
   ```

2. Break it down step by step:

   ```python
   numerator = 2 + 3
   print(f"Numerator: {numerator}")

   denominator = 4 + 5**6
   print(f"Denominator: {denominator}")

   result = numerator / denominator
   print(f"Final result: {result}")
   ```

**Expected Output:**
```
Numerator: 5
Denominator: 15629
Final result: 0.00032002048131121975
```

3. Try this one as well:

   $(1 - 3 \cdot 4^5)^6$

   ```python
   (1 - 3 * 4**5)**6
   ```

   Step by step:
   ```python
   inner_exponent = 4**5
   print(f"4^5 = {inner_exponent}")

   multiplication = 3 * inner_exponent
   print(f"3 * 4^5 = {multiplication}")

   subtraction = 1 - multiplication
   print(f"1 - 3 * 4^5 = {subtraction}")

   final_result = subtraction**6
   print(f"(1 - 3 * 4^5)^6 = {final_result}")
   ```

**Expected Output:**
```
4^5 = 1024
3 * 4^5 = 3072
1 - 3 * 4^5 = -3071
(1 - 3 * 4^5)^6 = 729071973630476174071
```
:::

---

## Task 5: Importing Modules

::: {.task-box}
1. In a new Code cell, try running:

   ```python
   sin(1)
   ```

   You should see:
   ```
   NameError: name 'sin' is not defined
   ```

2. To fix this, import the math module:

   ```python
   from math import *
   sin(1)
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   0.8414709848078965
   ```

3. Alternative ways to import and use `sin`:

   ```python
   # Method 1: Import specific function
   from math import sin
   print(sin(1))

   # Method 2: Import entire module
   import math
   print(math.sin(1))

   # Method 3: Import with alias
   import math as m
   print(m.sin(1))
   ```
:::

---

## Task 6: Case Sensitivity

::: {.task-box}
1. Assign a value to a variable:

   ```python
   my_variable = 5
   ```

2. Try printing with the wrong capitalization:

   ```python
   print(My_variable)
   ```
   You should see:
   ```
   NameError: name 'My_variable' is not defined
   ```

3. Print with the correct capitalization:

   ```python
   print(my_variable)
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   5
   ```

4. Try these examples to see how Python treats variable names:

   ```python
   my_variable = 5
   My_variable = 10
   MY_VARIABLE = 15
   my_Variable = 20

   print(f"my_variable = {my_variable}")
   print(f"My_variable = {My_variable}")
   print(f"MY_VARIABLE = {MY_VARIABLE}")
   print(f"my_Variable = {my_Variable}")
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   my_variable = 5
   My_variable = 10
   MY_VARIABLE = 15
   my_Variable = 20
   ```
:::

## Task 7: Commenting Code

::: {.task-box}
Add comments to your code from previous tasks. For example:

```python
# Task 2: Basic arithmetic
2 + 2  # Adding two integers

# Task 4: Complex mathematical expression
# Calculate (2 + 3) / (4 + 5^6)
numerator = 2 + 3  # Sum of 2 and 3
denominator = 4 + 5**6  # 4 plus 5 to the 6th power
result = numerator / denominator  # Final division
print(f"Result: {result}")

# Task 5: Import math module and use sin function
from math import *  # Import all math functions
angle_in_radians = 1  # Input angle in radians
sine_value = sin(angle_in_radians)  # Calculate sine
print(f"sin(1) = {sine_value}")

# Task 6: Variable assignment with proper naming
my_variable = 5  # Store the value 5 in my_variable
print(my_variable)  # Display the value

"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines and is useful
for longer explanations or documentation.
"""
```

**Good commenting practices:**
- Explain what the code does
- Clarify complex calculations
- Document variable purposes
- Use both inline (`#`) and block (`"""`) comments

## Task 8: Data Types

::: {.task-box}
1. Use the `type()` function to check data types:

   ```python
   print(type(1))           # Output: <class 'int'>
   print(type(1.1))         # Output: <class 'float'>
   print(type("hello"))     # Output: <class 'str'>
   ```

2. Try more examples:

   ```python
   print("Integer:", type(42))
   print("Float:", type(3.14159))
   print("String with single quotes:", type('Python'))
   print("String with double quotes:", type("Programming"))
   print("Boolean True:", type(True))
   print("Boolean False:", type(False))
   print("List:", type([1, 2, 3]))
   print("Tuple:", type((1, 2, 3)))
   print("Dictionary:", type({"key": "value"}))
   ```
:::

---

## Task 9: Variables and Calculations

::: {.task-box}
1. Add a Markdown cell:

   ```markdown
   # Task 9
   ```

2. Assign values to variables:

   ```python
   course = "PSTAT 5A"
   num_sections = 4
   section_capacity = 25
   ```

3. Update `num_sections`:

   ```python
   num_sections = num_sections + 1
   print(f"Updated number of sections: {num_sections}")
   # Alternative: num_sections += 1
   # Alternative: num_sections = 4 + 1
   ```

4. Predict and test expressions:

   ```python
   print(type(course))           # Expected: <class 'str'>
   print(type(num_sections))     # Expected: <class 'int'>
   print(num_sections * section_capacity) # Expected: 125
   ```

5. Calculate course capacity:

   ```python
   course_capacity = num_sections * section_capacity
   print(f"Course: {course}")
   print(f"Number of sections: {num_sections}")
   print(f"Capacity per section: {section_capacity}")
   print(f"Total course capacity: {course_capacity}")
   ```

6. Complete solution with comments:

   ```python
   # Step 2: Initial variable assignments
   course = "PSTAT 5A"          # Course name as string
   num_sections = 4             # Initial number of sections
   section_capacity = 25        # Maximum students per section

   # Step 3: A new section has been added
   num_sections = num_sections + 1  # Increment by 1, now equals 5

   # Step 4: Testing expressions with predictions
   print("Testing type() function:")
   print(f"type(course) = {type(course)}")  # Expected: <class 'str'>
   print(f"type(num_sections) = {type(num_sections)}")  # Expected: <class 'int'>
   print(f"num_sections * section_capacity = {num_sections * section_capacity}")  # Expected: 125

   # Step 5: Calculate total course capacity
   course_capacity = num_sections * section_capacity  # 5 × 25 = 125
   print(f"\nFinal Results:")
   print(f"Course: {course}")
   print(f"Total sections: {num_sections}")
   print(f"Capacity per section: {section_capacity}")
   print(f"Total course capacity: {course_capacity} students")
   ```
