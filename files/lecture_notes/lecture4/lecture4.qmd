## Welcome to Lecture 3 {.center}

**Introduction to Probability**

*Understanding the mathematics of uncertainty*

---

## Today's Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

- Define probability and understand its basic properties
- Identify sample spaces and events
- Apply fundamental probability rules
- Calculate conditional probabilities
- Determine when events are independent
- Use Bayes' theorem in simple applications

---

## What is Probability?

**Probability** is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur

- Ranges from 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%)
- **0**: Event will never occur
- **1**: Event will certainly occur
- **0.5**: Event has equal chance of occurring or not

:::{.fragment}
*Example*: The probability of getting heads when flipping a fair coin is 0.5
:::

---

## Why Study Probability?

Probability helps us:

- Make decisions under uncertainty
- Understand random processes
- Analyze data and draw conclusions
- Model real-world phenomena
- Assess risk and likelihood

:::{.fragment}
*Applications*: Weather forecasting, medical diagnosis, finance, quality control, gaming, insurance
:::

---

## Random Experiments

A **random experiment** is a process that:

1. Can be repeated under similar conditions
2. Has multiple possible outcomes
3. The outcome cannot be predicted with certainty

:::{.fragment}
**Examples:**
- Flipping a coin
- Rolling a die
- Drawing a card from a deck
- Measuring the lifetime of a light bulb
:::

---

## Sample Space

The **sample space** (denoted $S$ or $\Omega$) is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment

:::{.fragment}
**Examples:**

- Coin flip: $S = \{H, T\}$
- Die roll: $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$
- Two coin flips: $S = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$
:::

---

## Types of Sample Spaces

**Finite Sample Space**
: Limited number of outcomes
: Example: Rolling a die

**Infinite Sample Space**
: Unlimited outcomes (countable or uncountable)
: Example: Measuring exact height of students

---

## Events

An **event** is a subset of the sample space

- **Simple event**: Contains exactly one outcome
- **Compound event**: Contains multiple outcomes

:::{.fragment}
**Example** (rolling a die):
- Simple event: $A = \{3\}$ (rolling a 3)
- Compound event: $B = \{2, 4, 6\}$ (rolling an even number)
:::

---

## Event Notation

For a die roll with $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$:

- $A = \{1, 3, 5\}$ (rolling an odd number)
- $B = \{4, 5, 6\}$ (rolling 4 or higher)
- $C = \{6\}$ (rolling a six)

:::{.fragment}
We can describe events in words or using set notation
:::

---

## Set Operations with Events

**Union** ($A \cup B$): Event that $A$ OR $B$ occurs

**Intersection** ($A \cap B$): Event that $A$ AND $B$ occurs

**Complement** ($A^c$ or $\bar{A}$): Event that $A$ does NOT occur

---

## Visual Representation: Venn Diagrams

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-width: 8
%%| fig-height: 6

    subgraph S ["Sample Space S"]
        subgraph A ["Event A"]
            a1[" "]
        end
        subgraph B ["Event B"]
            b1[" "]
        end
        s1[" "]
        s2[" "]
    end
```

*Union, intersection, and complement can be visualized using Venn diagrams*

---

## Example: Set Operations

For die roll $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$:
- $A = \{1, 3, 5\}$ (odd numbers)
- $B = \{4, 5, 6\}$ (4 or higher)

:::{.fragment}
**Find:**
- $A \cup B = \{1, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$
- $A \cap B = \{5\}$
- $A^c = \{2, 4, 6\}$
:::

---

## Mutually Exclusive Events

Events $A$ and $B$ are **mutually exclusive** (or disjoint) if they cannot occur simultaneously

$$A \cap B = \emptyset$$

:::{.fragment}
**Example**: When rolling a die
- $A = \{1, 3, 5\}$ (odd)
- $B = \{2, 4, 6\}$ (even)

$A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive
:::

---

## The Classical Definition of Probability

For equally likely outcomes:

$$P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes in } A}{\text{Total number of outcomes in } S}$$

:::{.fragment}
**Example**: Probability of rolling an even number on a fair die

$$P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$$
:::

---

## Properties of Probability

1. **Non-negativity**: $P(A) \geq 0$ for any event $A$

2. **Normalization**: $P(S) = 1$

3. **Additivity**: If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, then
   $$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$

---

## The Complement Rule

$$P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$$

:::{.fragment}
**Example**: If the probability of rain is 0.3, what's the probability of no rain?

$$P(\text{no rain}) = 1 - P(\text{rain}) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$$
:::

---

## Practice Problem 1

A standard deck has 52 cards. What is the probability of drawing:

a) A heart?
b) A face card (Jack, Queen, King)?
c) The ace of spades?

:::{.fragment}
**Solutions:**
a) $P(\text{heart}) = \frac{13}{52} = \frac{1}{4}$
b) $P(\text{face card}) = \frac{12}{52} = \frac{3}{13}$
c) $P(\text{ace of spades}) = \frac{1}{52}$
:::

---

## The Addition Rule

For any two events $A$ and $B$:

$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$

:::{.fragment}
*Why subtract $P(A \cap B)$?*

We don't want to double-count outcomes that are in both events
:::

---

## Addition Rule Example

Drawing from a standard deck:
- $A$: Drawing a heart ($P(A) = \frac{13}{52}$)
- $B$: Drawing a face card ($P(B) = \frac{12}{52}$)

What's $P(A \cup B)$ (heart OR face card)?

:::{.fragment}
$P(A \cap B) = \frac{3}{52}$ (face cards that are hearts)

$P(A \cup B) = \frac{13}{52} + \frac{12}{52} - \frac{3}{52} = \frac{22}{52} = \frac{11}{26}$
:::

---

## Conditional Probability

**Conditional probability** is the probability of event $A$ given that event $B$ has occurred

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

provided $P(B) > 0$

---

## Conditional Probability Interpretation

$P(A|B)$ means:
- We know event $B$ has occurred
- What's the probability that $A$ also occurred?
- We "restrict" our sample space to only outcomes in $B$

---

## Conditional Probability Example

Drawing a card from a standard deck:
- $A$: Card is a heart
- $B$: Card is red

Find $P(A|B)$

:::{.fragment}
$P(A \cap B) = P(\text{heart}) = \frac{13}{52}$

$P(B) = P(\text{red}) = \frac{26}{52}$

$P(A|B) = \frac{13/52}{26/52} = \frac{13}{26} = \frac{1}{2}$
:::

---

## Independence

Events $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if:

$$P(A|B) = P(A)$$

or equivalently:

$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$$

:::{.fragment}
*Knowing that $B$ occurred doesn't change the probability of $A$*
:::

---

## Independence Example

Two coin flips:
- $A$: First flip is heads
- $B$: Second flip is heads

Are $A$ and $B$ independent?

:::{.fragment}
$P(A) = \frac{1}{2}$, $P(B) = \frac{1}{2}$

$P(A \cap B) = P(\text{HH}) = \frac{1}{4}$

$P(A) \times P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$

Yes, they are independent!
:::

---

## Multiplication Rule

**General case**: $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)$

**Independent events**: $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$

---

## Practice Problem 2

A jar contains 5 red balls and 3 blue balls. Two balls are drawn without replacement.

a) What's the probability both balls are red?
b) What's the probability the first is red and second is blue?

:::{.fragment}
a) $P(\text{both red}) = \frac{5}{8} \times \frac{4}{7} = \frac{20}{56} = \frac{5}{14}$

b) $P(\text{red then blue}) = \frac{5}{8} \times \frac{3}{7} = \frac{15}{56}$
:::

---

## Law of Total Probability

If events $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_n$ form a partition of the sample space, then:

$$P(A) = P(A|B_1)P(B_1) + P(A|B_2)P(B_2) + \cdots + P(A|B_n)P(B_n)$$

---

## Law of Total Probability Example

A factory has two machines:
- Machine 1: Produces 60% of items, 5% defective
- Machine 2: Produces 40% of items, 3% defective

What's the overall probability an item is defective?

:::{.fragment}
$P(\text{defective}) = P(D|M_1)P(M_1) + P(D|M_2)P(M_2)$

$= 0.05 \times 0.6 + 0.03 \times 0.4 = 0.03 + 0.012 = 0.042$
:::

---

## Bayes' Theorem

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}$$

This allows us to "reverse" conditional probabilities

:::{.fragment}
*Named after Thomas Bayes (1701-1761)*
:::

---

## Bayes' Theorem Components

- $P(A|B)$: **Posterior probability** - what we want to find
- $P(B|A)$: **Likelihood** - given $A$, probability of observing $B$
- $P(A)$: **Prior probability** - initial probability of $A$
- $P(B)$: **Marginal probability** - total probability of $B$

---

## Bayes' Theorem Example

Medical test for a disease:
- Disease affects 1% of population
- Test is 95% accurate for sick people
- Test is 90% accurate for healthy people

If someone tests positive, what's the probability they have the disease?

---

## Bayes' Theorem Solution

Let:
- $D$: Person has disease
- $T^+$: Test is positive

Given:
- $P(D) = 0.01$
- $P(T^+|D) = 0.95$
- $P(T^-|D^c) = 0.90$, so $P(T^+|D^c) = 0.10$

:::{.fragment}
$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$
$= 0.95 \times 0.01 + 0.10 \times 0.99 = 0.1085$
:::

---

## Bayes' Theorem Solution (cont.)

$$P(D|T^+) = \frac{P(T^+|D) \times P(D)}{P(T^+)} = \frac{0.95 \times 0.01}{0.1085} \approx 0.088$$

:::{.fragment}
**Surprising result**: Even with a positive test, there's only an 8.8% chance of having the disease!

*This is due to the low base rate of the disease*
:::

---

## Common Probability Mistakes

1. **Confusing $P(A|B)$ with $P(B|A)$**
   - Prosecutor's fallacy

2. **Assuming independence when events are dependent**

3. **Ignoring base rates** (as in the medical test example)

4. **Double counting in union calculations**

---

## Tree Diagrams

Tree diagrams help visualize sequential events and calculate probabilities

```
                    0.6   Red
            0.7 ──┐
                    0.4   Blue
    
                    0.3   Red  
            0.3 ──┐
                    0.7   Blue
```

*Example: Drawing from different urns*

---

## Practice Problem 3

Two fair dice are rolled. Find:

a) $P(\text{sum} = 7)$
b) $P(\text{sum} = 7 | \text{first die shows 3})$
c) Are these events independent?

:::{.fragment}
a) 6 ways out of 36: $P(\text{sum} = 7) = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$

b) Given first die is 3, need second die to be 4: $P(\text{sum} = 7 | \text{first} = 3) = \frac{1}{6}$

c) Yes, they're independent since $P(A|B) = P(A)$
:::

---

## Counting and Probability

Sometimes we need to count outcomes:

**Multiplication Principle**: If task 1 can be done in $m$ ways and task 2 in $n$ ways, both can be done in $m \times n$ ways

**Permutations**: Arrangements where order matters
$$P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$

**Combinations**: Selections where order doesn't matter
$$C(n,r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$

---

## Counting Example

How many ways can you arrange 5 people in a row?

:::{.fragment}
This is a permutation: $P(5,5) = 5! = 120$ ways
:::

:::{.fragment}
How many ways can you choose 3 people from 5 for a committee?

This is a combination: $C(5,3) = \binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = 10$ ways
:::

---

## Probability with Counting

**Example**: A committee of 3 people is chosen from 8 people (5 women, 3 men). What's the probability all 3 are women?

:::{.fragment}
Total ways to choose 3 from 8: $\binom{8}{3} = 56$

Ways to choose 3 women from 5: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$

Probability: $\frac{10}{56} = \frac{5}{28}$
:::

---

## Probability Distributions Preview

A **probability distribution** assigns probabilities to all possible outcomes

For discrete random variables:
- **Probability mass function** (PMF)
- **Cumulative distribution function** (CDF)

*We'll explore this more in future lectures*

---

## Common Discrete Distributions

**Uniform Distribution**: All outcomes equally likely

**Binomial Distribution**: Number of successes in fixed trials

**Geometric Distribution**: Number of trials until first success

*Examples and details coming in later lectures*

---

## Real-World Applications

**Medical Diagnosis**: Using Bayes' theorem for test interpretation

**Quality Control**: Probability of defective items

**Finance**: Risk assessment and portfolio theory

**Sports**: Probability of wins, fantasy sports

**Insurance**: Calculating premiums based on risk

---

## Key Formulas Summary

- **Basic probability**: $P(A) = \frac{\text{favorable outcomes}}{\text{total outcomes}}$
- **Complement**: $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$
- **Addition**: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
- **Conditional**: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
- **Independence**: $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$
- **Bayes'**: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}$

---

## Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Identify** the sample space and events
2. **Determine** if events are independent or mutually exclusive
3. **Choose** the appropriate rule or formula
4. **Calculate** step by step
5. **Check** if your answer makes sense

---

## Practice Problem 4

A bag contains 4 red, 3 blue, and 2 green marbles. Three marbles are drawn without replacement.

Find the probability that:
a) All three are red
b) No two are the same color
c) At least one is blue

---

## Practice Problem 4 Solutions

a) All red: $\frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{24}{504} = \frac{1}{21}$

b) Different colors: $\frac{4 \times 3 \times 2}{9 \times 8 \times 7} \times 3! = \frac{24 \times 6}{504} = \frac{144}{504} = \frac{2}{7}$

c) At least one blue: $1 - P(\text{no blue}) = 1 - \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4}{9 \times 8 \times 7} = 1 - \frac{120}{504} = \frac{384}{504} = \frac{16}{21}$

---
