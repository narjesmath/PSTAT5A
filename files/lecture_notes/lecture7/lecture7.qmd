## The Fundamental Counting Principle

**Multiplication Rule**: If a procedure consists of $k$ separate tasks where:
- Task 1 can be performed in $n_1$ ways
- Task 2 can be performed in $n_2$ ways
- ...
- Task $k$ can be performed in $n_k$ ways

Then the entire procedure can be performed in $n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_k$ ways

---

## Simple Counting Example

**License Plates**: Format ABC-123
- First position: 26 letters
- Second position: 26 letters  
- Third position: 26 letters
- Fourth position: 10 digits
- Fifth position: 10 digits
- Sixth position: 10 digits

:::{.fragment}
Total possibilities: $26 \times 26 \times 26 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 26^3 \times 10^3 = 17,576,000$
:::

---

## Restaurant Menu Example

A restaurant offers:
- 4 appetizers
- 6 main courses  
- 3 desserts

How many different three-course meals are possible?

:::{.fragment}
**Solution**: $4 \times 6 \times 3 = 72$ different meals
:::

---

## Practice Problem 1

A password must contain:
- Exactly 8 characters
- Each character is either a letter (26 possibilities) or digit (10 possibilities)

How many possible passwords are there?

:::{.fragment}
**Solution**: Each position has $26 + 10 = 36$ choices

Total: $36^8 = 2,821,109,907,456$ passwords
:::

---

## What Are Permutations?

**Permutation**: An arrangement of objects where **order matters**

:::{.fragment}
**Examples where order matters**:
- Race finish positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Seating arrangements
- Passwords
- DNA sequences
:::

---

## Permutations of $n$ Distinct Objects

The number of ways to arrange $n$ distinct objects is:

$$n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1$$

:::{.fragment}
**Example**: How many ways can 5 people sit in a row?

$5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$ ways
:::

---

## Factorial Values

| $n$ | $n!$ |
|-----|------|
| 0   | 1    |
| 1   | 1    |
| 2   | 2    |
| 3   | 6    |
| 4   | 24   |
| 5   | 120  |
| 10  | 3,628,800 |

:::{.fragment}
*Note*: $0! = 1$ by definition
:::

---

## Permutations of $r$ Objects from $n$

**$P(n,r)$** or **$_nP_r$**: Number of ways to arrange $r$ objects selected from $n$ distinct objects

$$P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$

:::{.fragment}
**Example**: How many ways can we select and arrange 3 people from a group of 8 for president, vice-president, and secretary?

$P(8,3) = \frac{8!}{(8-3)!} = \frac{8!}{5!} = 8 \times 7 \times 6 = 336$
:::

---

## Understanding $P(n,r)$

Why is $P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$?

- First position: $n$ choices
- Second position: $(n-1)$ choices  
- Third position: $(n-2)$ choices
- ...
- $r$-th position: $(n-r+1)$ choices

:::{.fragment}
Total: $n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \cdots \times (n-r+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$
:::

---

## Practice Problem 2

A baseball team has 15 players. How many ways can the coach:

a) Arrange all 15 players in a line?
b) Choose and arrange 9 players for the starting lineup (batting order matters)?

:::{.fragment}
**Solutions:**
a) $15! = 1,307,674,368,000$
b) $P(15,9) = \frac{15!}{6!} = 1,816,214,400$
:::

---

## Permutations with Repetition

When some objects are identical, we have **fewer** distinct arrangements

If we have $n$ objects where:
- $n_1$ are of type 1
- $n_2$ are of type 2  
- ...
- $n_k$ are of type $k$

Number of distinct arrangements: $\frac{n!}{n_1! \times n_2! \times \cdots \times n_k!}$

---

## Permutations with Repetition Example

How many distinct arrangements are there of the letters in "STATISTICS"?

**S-T-A-T-I-S-T-I-C-S**
- Total letters: 10
- S appears 3 times
- T appears 3 times  
- A appears 1 time
- I appears 2 times
- C appears 1 time

:::{.fragment}
$\frac{10!}{3! \times 3! \times 1! \times 2! \times 1!} = \frac{3,628,800}{6 \times 6 \times 1 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{3,628,800}{72} = 50,400$
:::

---

## What Are Combinations?

**Combination**: A selection of objects where **order does NOT matter**

:::{.fragment}
**Examples where order doesn't matter**:
- Choosing committee members
- Selecting pizza toppings
- Forming study groups
- Lottery number selection
:::

---

## Combinations Formula

**$C(n,r)$** or **$\binom{n}{r}$**: Number of ways to choose $r$ objects from $n$ distinct objects (order doesn't matter)

$$C(n,r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$

:::{.fragment}
**Example**: How many ways can we choose 3 people from a group of 8 for a committee?

$C(8,3) = \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \frac{8!}{3! \times 5!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56$
:::

---

## Relationship: Permutations vs Combinations

$$P(n,r) = C(n,r) \times r!$$

**Why?** For each combination of $r$ objects, there are $r!$ ways to arrange them

:::{.fragment}
**Example**: $P(8,3) = C(8,3) \times 3! = 56 \times 6 = 336$ ✓
:::

---

## Key Decision: Permutation or Combination?

**Ask yourself**: Does order matter?

**Order matters** → Use **Permutations**
- Arrangements, sequences, rankings

**Order doesn't matter** → Use **Combinations**  
- Selections, groups, subsets

---

## Practice Problem 3

From a class of 20 students:

a) How many ways to choose 5 students for a study group?
b) How many ways to choose a president, vice-president, and secretary?
c) How many ways to arrange all 20 students in a circle?

:::{.fragment}
**Solutions:**
a) $C(20,5) = \frac{20!}{5! \times 15!} = 15,504$ (order doesn't matter)
b) $P(20,3) = \frac{20!}{17!} = 6,840$ (order matters)
c) $(20-1)! = 19!$ (circular permutation)
:::

---

## Properties of Combinations

1. **Symmetry**: $\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n}{n-r}$

2. **Pascal's Identity**: $\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n-1}{r-1} + \binom{n-1}{r}$

3. **Boundary conditions**: $\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1$

:::{.fragment}
**Example**: $\binom{8}{3} = \binom{8}{5} = 56$ ✓
:::

---

## Pascal's Triangle

```
           1
         1   1
       1   2   1
     1   3   3   1
   1   4   6   4   1
 1   5  10  10   5   1
1   6  15  20  15   6   1
```

Each number is $\binom{n}{r}$ where $n$ is the row and $r$ is the position

---

## Binomial Theorem

$$(x + y)^n = \sum_{r=0}^{n} \binom{n}{r} x^{n-r} y^r$$

:::{.fragment}
**Example**: $(x + y)^3 = \binom{3}{0}x^3 + \binom{3}{1}x^2y + \binom{3}{2}xy^2 + \binom{3}{3}y^3$

$= x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3$
:::

---

## Counting and Probability

**Example**: A committee of 4 people is chosen from 7 women and 5 men. What's the probability that exactly 2 are women?

Total ways to choose 4 from 12: $\binom{12}{4} = 495$

Ways to choose 2 women from 7: $\binom{7}{2} = 21$
Ways to choose 2 men from 5: $\binom{5}{2} = 10$

:::{.fragment}
Favorable outcomes: $\binom{7}{2} \times \binom{5}{2} = 21 \times 10 = 210$

Probability: $\frac{210}{495} = \frac{14}{33}$
:::

---

## Practice Problem 4

A standard deck has 52 cards. What's the probability that a 5-card hand contains:

a) Exactly 3 aces?
b) At least 1 ace?

:::{.fragment}
a) Ways to get 3 aces from 4: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
   Ways to get 2 non-aces from 48: $\binom{48}{2} = 1,128$
   Total 5-card hands: $\binom{52}{5} = 2,598,960$
   
   Probability: $\frac{4 \times 1,128}{2,598,960} = \frac{4,512}{2,598,960} \approx 0.00174$
:::

---

## Practice Problem 4 (continued)

b) At least 1 ace = 1 - (no aces)

Ways to choose 5 cards with no aces: $\binom{48}{5} = 1,712,304$

:::{.fragment}
$P(\text{at least 1 ace}) = 1 - \frac{\binom{48}{5}}{\binom{52}{5}} = 1 - \frac{1,712,304}{2,598,960} \approx 0.341$
:::

---

## Circular Permutations

When arranging objects in a **circle**, we fix one object to eliminate rotational symmetry

Number of circular permutations of $n$ objects: $(n-1)!$

:::{.fragment}
**Example**: How many ways can 6 people sit around a circular table?

$(6-1)! = 5! = 120$ ways
:::

---

## Permutations with Restrictions

**Example**: How many 6-letter "words" can be formed from the letters A, B, C, D, E, F if:
- No letter is repeated
- A and B must be adjacent

:::{.fragment}
**Solution**: Treat AB as a single unit
- 5 units to arrange: (AB), C, D, E, F → $5! = 120$ ways
- A and B can be arranged within their unit: $2! = 2$ ways
- Total: $5! \times 2! = 240$ ways
:::

---

## The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

For two sets $A$ and $B$:
$$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$$

For three sets $A$, $B$, and $C$:
$$|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|$$

---

## Inclusion-Exclusion Example

How many integers from 1 to 100 are divisible by 2, 3, or 5?

Let:
- $A$ = divisible by 2: $|A| = 50$
- $B$ = divisible by 3: $|B| = 33$  
- $C$ = divisible by 5: $|C| = 20$

:::{.fragment}
$|A \cap B| = 16$ (divisible by 6)
$|A \cap C| = 10$ (divisible by 10)
$|B \cap C| = 6$ (divisible by 15)
$|A \cap B \cap C| = 3$ (divisible by 30)
:::

---

## Inclusion-Exclusion Solution

$$|A \cup B \cup C| = 50 + 33 + 20 - 16 - 10 - 6 + 3 = 74$$

:::{.fragment}
**Answer**: 74 integers from 1 to 100 are divisible by at least one of 2, 3, or 5
:::

---

## Derangements

A **derangement** is a permutation where no object appears in its original position

Number of derangements of $n$ objects:
$$D_n = n! \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!} \approx \frac{n!}{e}$$

:::{.fragment}
**Example**: How many ways can 4 people return hats to the wrong owners?

$D_4 = 4! \left(\frac{1}{0!} - \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} - \frac{1}{3!} + \frac{1}{4!}\right) = 24 \times \frac{9}{24} = 9$
:::

---

## Multinomial Coefficients

Number of ways to divide $n$ objects into groups of sizes $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$:

$$\binom{n}{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k} = \frac{n!}{n_1! \times n_2! \times \cdots \times n_k!}$$

:::{.fragment}
**Example**: How many ways can 12 people be divided into 3 teams of 4?

$\binom{12}{4,4,4} = \frac{12!}{4! \times 4! \times 4!} = 34,650$
:::

---

## Stars and Bars

**Problem**: Number of ways to distribute $n$ identical objects into $k$ distinct bins

**Solution**: $\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$ or $\binom{n+k-1}{n}$

:::{.fragment}
**Example**: How many ways can you distribute 10 identical candies to 4 children?

$\binom{10+4-1}{4-1} = \binom{13}{3} = 286$ ways
:::

---

## Practice Problem 5

A pizza shop offers 12 toppings. How many different pizzas can you order if:

a) You want exactly 4 toppings?
b) You want at most 3 toppings?
c) You want at least 1 topping?

:::{.fragment}
**Solutions:**
a) $\binom{12}{4} = 495$
b) $\binom{12}{0} + \binom{12}{1} + \binom{12}{2} + \binom{12}{3} = 1 + 12 + 66 + 220 = 299$
c) $2^{12} - 1 = 4,095$ (all subsets except empty set)
:::

---

## Advanced Counting: Stirling Numbers

**Stirling numbers of the second kind** $S(n,k)$: Number of ways to partition $n$ objects into $k$ non-empty subsets

**Bell numbers** $B_n$: Total number of ways to partition $n$ objects
$$B_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} S(n,k)$$

*These are advanced topics for further study*

---

## Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Read carefully**: What exactly are we counting?
2. **Identify the type**: Permutation, combination, or other?
3. **Check for restrictions**: Are there constraints?
4. **Does order matter?**: This determines permutation vs combination
5. **Break down complex problems**: Use multiplication principle
6. **Verify your answer**: Does it make sense?

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Confusing permutations and combinations**
   - Always ask: "Does order matter?"

2. **Forgetting about restrictions**
   - Read the problem carefully

3. **Double counting**
   - Make sure you're not counting the same arrangement twice

4. **Not considering the complement**
   - Sometimes "at least" problems are easier using complements

---

## Practice Problem 6

A class has 15 students: 8 women and 7 men. How many ways can we:

a) Form a committee of 5 people with exactly 3 women?
b) Arrange 6 people in a row with alternating genders (starting with a woman)?

:::{.fragment}
**Solutions:**
a) $\binom{8}{3} \times \binom{7}{2} = 56 \times 21 = 1,176$
b) Choose 3 women from 8: $P(8,3) = 336$
   Choose 3 men from 7: $P(7,3) = 210$
   Total: $336 \times 210 = 70,560$
:::

## Practice Problem 7

A standard deck of cards is shuffled. What's the probability that:

a) The top 4 cards are all hearts?
b) In a 13-card hand, you get exactly one card from each rank?

:::{.fragment}
**Solutions:**
a) $\frac{13}{52} \times \frac{12}{51} \times \frac{11}{50} \times \frac{10}{49} = \frac{13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{52 \times 51 \times 50 \times 49} \approx 0.0026$

b) Choose 1 card from each of 13 ranks: $4^{13}$
   Total 13-card hands: $\binom{52}{13}$
   Probability: $\frac{4^{13}}{\binom{52}{13}} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-6}$
:::
