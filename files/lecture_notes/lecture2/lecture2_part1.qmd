## Statistics

::: {.incremental}
<q>Facts are stubborn, but statistics are more pliable.</q>

Mark Twain

- Statistics refers to the mathematics and techniques with which we understand data. ^[[(source)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781491901410/ch05.html)]

## What are Descriptive Statistics? 
::: {.incremental}
**Descriptive statistics** are numerical and graphical methods used to summarize, organize, and describe data in a meaningful way.

::: {.fragment}
### Purpose of Descriptive Statistics
- **Summarize large datasets** into manageable information
- **Identify patterns** and trends in data
- **Communicate findings** clearly to others
- **Prepare data** for further analysis
- **Make initial assessments** about data quality
:::

## Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics {.smaller}


| Descriptive Statistics | Inferential Statistics |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Describes what the data shows | Makes predictions about populations |
| Summarizes sample data | Uses sample data to make generalizations |
| No conclusions beyond the data | Draws conclusions beyond the immediate data |
| Examples: mean, median, graphs | Examples: hypothesis testing, confidence intervals |

# Types of Data and Measurement Scales {#sec-data-types}
*15 minutes*

## Why Data Types Matter

Understanding data types is crucial because:

::: {.incremental}
- Different statistics are appropriate for different data types
- Statistical methods depend on the level of measurement
- Misapplying statistics can lead to incorrect conclusions

## Categorical Data (Qualitative)
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
### Nominal Data
- Categories with no natural order
- Examples: gender, color, brand names, marital status
- Appropriate statistics: mode, frequency counts, proportions
:::
::: {.column}
### Ordinal Data
- Categories with a natural order or ranking
- Examples: education level, satisfaction ratings, letter grades
- Appropriate statistics: mode, median, percentiles
:::
::::  
<!-- end columns -->








## Numerical Data (Quantitative)
:::{.fragment}
### Discrete Data
- Countable values, often integers
- Examples: number of children, cars sold, defective items
- Can take on finite or countably infinite values
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-up}
### Continuous Data
- Can take any value within a range
- Examples: height, weight, temperature, time
- Measured rather than counted

## Measurement Scales Summary {.smaller}

| Scale | Type | Properties | Examples | Appropriate Statistics |
|-------|------|------------|----------|----------------------|
| Nominal | Categorical | Categories only | Gender, Color | Mode, Frequency |
| Ordinal | Categorical | Order matters | Rankings, Grades | Mode, Median |
| Interval | Numerical | Equal intervals, no true zero | Temperature (°C) | Mean, Median, Mode |
| Ratio | Numerical | Equal intervals, true zero | Height, Weight, Income | All statistics |

## What is Central Tendency?

Central tendency describes the center or typical value of a dataset. 

It answers the question: **"What is a representative value for this data?"**

# The Mean (Arithmetic Average)
*12 minutes*

## Definition and Formula

The **mean** is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.

. . .

### Formula
- For a sample: $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x}{n}$
- For a population: $\mu = \frac{\sum x}{N}$

Where:

- $\bar{x}$ (x-bar) = sample mean
- $\mu$ (mu) = population mean
- $\sum x$ = sum of all values
- $n$ = sample size, $N$ = population size

## Example Calculation

Student test scores: 85, 90, 78, 92, 88

. . .

Mean = $\frac{85 + 90 + 78 + 92 + 88}{5} = \frac{433}{5} = 86.6$

## Properties of the Mean

- **Uses all data points** - every value affects the mean
- **Sensitive to outliers** - extreme values can distort the mean
- **Unique** - there is only one mean for a dataset
- **Can be calculated** for interval and ratio data
- **Balancing point** - sum of deviations from mean equals zero

## When to Use the Mean

✅ **Use the mean when:**

- Data is **approximately symmetric**
- **No extreme outliers** present
- Working with **interval or ratio data**
- Need to use the value in **further calculations**

## Advantages and Disadvantages {.smaller}

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Advantages
- Uses all information in the dataset
- Algebraically defined and mathematically tractable
- Widely understood and accepted
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Disadvantages
- Affected by outliers and skewed distributions
- May not represent a typical value in skewed data
- Cannot be used with nominal or ordinal data
:::

:::

# The Median
*12 minutes*

## Definition

The **median** is the middle value when data is arranged in ascending or descending order.

## Calculation Steps

1. **Arrange data** in ascending order
2. **Find the middle position:**
   - If n is odd: position = $\frac{n + 1}{2}$
   - If n is even: average of positions $\frac{n}{2}$ and $\frac{n}{2} + 1$

## Examples
:::{.fragment}
### Odd number of values:
:::{.incremental}
- Data: 12, 15, 18, 20, 25

- What is the median here ?

- **Median = 18** (middle value)
:::
:::
:::{.fragment}
### Even number of values:
:::{.incremental}
- Data: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35
  
- What is the median here ?
  
- **Median = $\frac{20 + 25}{2} = 22.5$**
:::
:::

## Properties of the Median
:::{.incremental}
- **Not affected by outliers** - resistant measure
- **Represents the 50th percentile**
- **May not be an actual data value** (when n is even)
- **Appropriate for ordinal, interval, and ratio data**
- **Divides data into two equal halves**
:::

## When to Use the Median

✅ **Use the median when:**

- Data is **skewed** (not symmetric)
- **Outliers** are present
- Working with **ordinal data**
- Want a **robust measure** of central tendency
- Data represents **income, housing prices**, or similar distributions

## Median vs Mean with Outliers

Consider household incomes: $30,000, $32,000, $35,000, $38,000, $2,000,000

. . .

- **Mean = $427,000** (not representative of typical household)
- **Median = $35,000** (better represents typical household)
