**📚 Key Formulas Reference:**

**Basic Probability:**

- **Conditional Probability:** $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
  
- **Law of Total Probability:** $P(A) = \sum P(A|B_i) \cdot P(B_i)$
  
- **Addition Rule:** $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
  
- **Multiplication Rule:** $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B|A) = P(B) \cdot P(A|B)$

**Counting:**

- **Multiplication Rule:** If a procedure consists of $k$ steps, with $n_1$ ways for step 1, $n_2$ for step 2, ..., $n_k$ for step $k$, then total ways: $n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_k$

- **Factorial:** $n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1$

- **Permutations:** $P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$
  
- **Combinations:** $C(n,r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$

# Section A: Probability - SOLUTIONS
*⏱️ Estimated time: 8 minutes*

::: {.problem}
**Problem A1: Probability Distributions - SOLUTION**

For a valid probability distribution, two conditions must be met:

1. All probabilities must be non-negative (≥ 0)
   
2. The sum of all probabilities must equal 1

**Analysis:**

**(a) Invalid** 
$$\text{Sum} = 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 1.2 > 1$$
The probabilities sum to more than 1, violating condition 2.

**(b) Valid** 
$$\text{Sum} = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 1$$
All probabilities are non-negative and sum to 1. This represents a class where everyone receives a C.

**(c) Invalid** 
$$\text{Sum} = 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0 + 0 = 0.9 < 1$$
The probabilities sum to less than 1, violating condition 2.

**(d) Invalid** 
Contains $P(F) = -0.1 < 0$
Although the sum would equal 1.0, the probability for grade F is negative, violating condition 1.

**(e) Valid** 
$$\text{Sum} = 0.2 + 0.4 + 0.2 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 1.0$$
All probabilities are non-negative and sum to 1.

**(f) Invalid** 
Contains $P(B) = -0.1 < 0$
Although the sum equals 1.0, the probability for grade B is negative, violating condition 1.

# Section B: Permutations and Combinations - SOLUTIONS
*⏱️ Estimated time: 15 minutes*

::: {.problem}
**Problem B1: Permutations and Combinations - SOLUTION**

**Part (a):** How many 6-character passwords can be formed using 3 specific letters and 3 specific digits if repetitions are not allowed and letters must come before digits?

**Solution:**
Since letters must come before digits, we have a fixed structure: **LLL DDD**

**Step 1:** Arrange 3 letters in the first 3 positions

- This is a permutation: $P(3,3) = \frac{3!}{(3-3)!} = \frac{3!}{0!} = 3! = 6$ ways

**Step 2:** Arrange 3 digits in the last 3 positions  

- This is a permutation: $P(3,3) = \frac{3!}{(3-3)!} = \frac{3!}{0!} = 3! = 6$ ways

**Step 3:** Apply multiplication principle
$$\text{Total passwords} = 6 \times 6 = \boxed{36 \text{ passwords}}$$

**Part (b):** If the team wants to select 4 people from 12 employees to form a security committee where order doesn't matter, how many ways can this be done?

**Solution:**
Since order doesn't matter, this is a **combination** problem.

$$C(12,4) = \binom{12}{4} = \frac{12!}{4!(12-4)!} = \frac{12!}{4! \cdot 8!}$$

$$= \frac{12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{11,880}{24} = \boxed{495 \text{ ways}}$$

# Section C: Conditional Probability - SOLUTIONS
*⏱️ Estimated time: 12 minutes*

::: {.problem}
**Problem C1: Drawing Cards (Without Replacement) - SOLUTION**

**Given Information:**

- Standard 52-card deck
  
- Drawing two cards without replacement
  
- $A = \{\text{"first card is a heart"}\}$
  
- $B = \{\text{"second card is an ace"}\}$

**Solution:**

**1. P(A)**

There are 13 hearts in a 52-card deck.
$$P(A) = \frac{13}{52} = \boxed{\frac{1}{4} = 0.2500}$$

**2. P(A and B)**

We need both events to occur: first card is a heart AND second card is an ace.

**Case 1:** First card is the Ace of Hearts
- $P(\text{1st card is Ace of Hearts}) = \frac{1}{52}$
  
- $P(\text{2nd card is an ace | 1st card is Ace of Hearts}) = \frac{3}{51}$ (3 aces left)
  
- $P(\text{Case 1}) = \frac{1}{52} \times \frac{3}{51} = \frac{3}{2652}$

**Case 2:** First card is a non-ace heart
- $P(\text{1st card is non-ace heart}) = \frac{12}{52}$ (12 non-ace hearts)
  
- $P(\text{2nd card is an ace | 1st card is non-ace heart}) = \frac{4}{51}$ (4 aces left)
  
- $P(\text{Case 2}) = \frac{12}{52} \times \frac{4}{51} = \frac{48}{2652}$

$$P(A \text{ and } B) = \frac{3}{2652} + \frac{48}{2652} = \frac{51}{2652} = \boxed{\frac{1}{52} = 0.0192}$$

**3. P(B|A)**

Using the definition of conditional probability:
$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(A)} = \frac{\frac{1}{52}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{52} \times \frac{4}{1} = \boxed{\frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13} = 0.0769}$$

**Alternative approach:** Given that the first card is a heart:

- If it's the Ace of Hearts: 3 aces remain out of 51 cards
  
- If it's a non-ace heart: 4 aces remain out of 51 cards
  
- $P(B|A) = \frac{1}{13} \times \frac{3}{51} + \frac{12}{13} \times \frac{4}{51} = \frac{3 + 48}{13 \times 51} = \frac{51}{663} = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}$

**4. P(B)**

Using the Law of Total Probability. Let $A^c$ = "first card is not a heart"

$$P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c)$$

We know:

- $P(A) = \frac{1}{4}$ and $P(A^c) = \frac{3}{4}$
  
- $P(B|A) = \frac{1}{13}$ (from part 3)
  
- $P(B|A^c) = \frac{4}{51}$ (if first card isn't a heart, all 4 aces remain)

$$P(B) = \frac{1}{13} \times \frac{1}{4} + \frac{4}{51} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{52} + \frac{12}{204} = \frac{1}{52} + \frac{3}{51}$$

$$= \frac{51 + 156}{52 \times 51} = \frac{207}{2652} = \boxed{\frac{4}{51} = 0.0784}$$

**5. Comparison of P(B|A) vs P(B)**

$$P(B|A) = \frac{1}{13} = 0.0769$$
$$P(B) = \frac{4}{51} = 0.0784$$

**Analysis:** $P(B|A) < P(B)$

**Explanation:** The probability of getting an ace on the second draw is slightly **lower** when we know the first card is a heart compared to when we don't know anything about the first card. This happens because:

- When the first card is a heart, there's a $\frac{1}{13}$ chance it's the Ace of Hearts, removing one ace from the deck
  
- This makes it slightly less likely to draw an ace on the second draw
  
- This demonstrates **dependence** - the events are not independent because drawing without replacement creates dependence between successive draws

# Section D: Advanced Counting with Restrictions - SOLUTIONS
*⏱️ Estimated time: 15 minutes*

::: {.problem}
**Problem D1: Advanced Counting with Restrictions - SOLUTION**

**Given:**

- 6 appetizer options (including 1 seafood)
  
- 8 main course options (including 1 vegetarian, and 3 that are beef or chicken)
  
- 5 dessert options (including 1 chocolate)

**Restrictions:**

1. Seafood appetizer → cannot choose vegetarian main course
   
2. Chocolate dessert → must choose beef or chicken main course (3 specific options)

**Part (a):** How many valid meal combinations are possible?

**Solution using cases:**

**Case 1: Seafood appetizer is chosen**

- 1 appetizer choice (seafood)
  
- 7 main course choices (8 total minus 1 vegetarian)
  
- 5 dessert choices (no restrictions)
  
- Total: $1 \times 7 \times 5 = 35$ combinations

**Case 2: Non-seafood appetizer + chocolate dessert**

- 5 appetizer choices (6 total minus 1 seafood)
  
- 3 main course choices (only beef or chicken allowed with chocolate)
  
- 1 dessert choice (chocolate)
  
- Total: $5 \times 3 \times 1 = 15$ combinations

**Case 3: Non-seafood appetizer + non-chocolate dessert**

- 5 appetizer choices (6 total minus 1 seafood)
  
- 8 main course choices (no restrictions since no seafood appetizer)
  
- 4 dessert choices (5 total minus 1 chocolate)
  
- Total: $5 \times 8 \times 4 = 160$ combinations

**Total valid combinations:**
$$35 + 15 + 160 = \boxed{210 \text{ combinations}}$$

**Verification using complementary counting:**

- Total unrestricted combinations: $6 \times 8 \times 5 = 240$
  
- Invalid combinations to subtract:
  
  - Seafood + vegetarian + any dessert: $1 \times 1 \times 5 = 5$
  
  - Non-seafood + chocolate + non-beef/chicken: $5 \times 5 \times 1 = 25$
  
- Valid combinations: $240 - 5 - 25 = 210$ ✓

**Part (b):** If customers choose randomly among valid combinations, what is the probability someone chooses the chocolate dessert?

**Solution:**
From our case analysis, combinations with chocolate dessert come only from Case 2:

- Combinations with chocolate dessert: 15
  
- Total valid combinations: 210

$$P(\text{chocolate dessert}) = \frac{15}{210} = \frac{1}{14} = \boxed{0.0714}$$

**Alternative verification:**

We can also calculate this directly:

- Non-seafood appetizers: 5 choices
  
- With chocolate dessert, must choose from 3 main courses
  
- Valid chocolate combinations: $5 \times 3 = 15$
  
- Probability: $\frac{15}{210} = \frac{1}{14} = 0.0714$ ✓
