**üìö Key Formulas Reference:**

**Basic Probability:**

- **Conditional Probability:** $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
  
- **Law of Total Probability:** $P(A) = \sum P(A|B_i) \cdot P(B_i)$

- **Addition Rule:** $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$

- **Multiplication Rule:** $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B|A) = P(B) \cdot P(A|B)$

**Counting:**

- **Multiplication Rule:** If a procedure consists of $k$ steps, with $n_1$ ways for step 1, $n_2$ for step 2, ..., $n_k$ for step $k$, then total ways: $n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_k$

- **Factorial:** $n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1$

- **Permutations:** $P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$
  
- **Combinations:** $C(n,r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$

# Section A: Probability
*‚è±Ô∏è Estimated time: 8 minutes*

::: {.problem}
**Problem A1: Probability Distributions**

Each row in the table below is a proposed grade distribution for a class. Identify each as a valid or invalid probability distribution, and explain your reasoning.

| Class | A   | B   | C   | D   | F    |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|
| (a)   | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.1  |
| (b)   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0    |
| (c)   | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0   | 0    |
| (d)   | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.1 | -0.1 |
| (e)   | 0.2 | 0.4 | 0.2 | 0.1 | 0.1  |
| (f)   | 0   | -0.1| 1.1 | 0   | 0    |

# Section B: Permutations and Combination
*‚è±Ô∏è Estimated time: 15 minutes*

::: {.problem}
**Problem B1: Permutations and Combinations**

A cybersecurity team needs to create a secure access protocol.

**Part (a):** How many 6-character passwords can be formed using 3 specific letters and 3 specific digits if repetitions are not allowed and letters must come before digits?

:::{.callout-tip}
Since letters must come before digits, think of this as two separate arrangement problems:

- First, arrange the 3 letters in the first 3 positions
  
- Then, arrange the 3 digits in the last 3 positions
  
- Use the multiplication principle to combine these results
:::



**Part (b):** If the team wants to select 4 people from 12 employees to form a security committee where order doesn't matter, how many ways can this be done?

:::{.callout-tip}
Since order doesn't matter, this is a combination problem. Ask yourself:

- Are we arranging people in specific positions, or just selecting a group?
  
- Which formula should you use: $P(n,r)$ or $C(n,r)$?

# Section C: Conditional Probability
*‚è±Ô∏è Estimated time: 12 minutes*

::: {.problem}
**Problem C1: Drawing Cards (Without Replacement)**

You draw two cards, one after the other, from a standard 52-card deck without putting the first card back. 
Let

A = $\{\text{‚Äúfirst card is a heart‚Äù}\}$,

B = $\{\text{‚Äúsecond card is an ace‚Äù}\}$.

1.	P(A)

2.	$P\bigl(A\text{ and }B\bigr)$

3.	$P\bigl(B\mid A\bigr)$

4.	P(B)

5.	Compare your answers in (3) vs. (4).  Why are they different (or the same)?  What does this tell you about drawing cards without replacement?

# Section D: Conditional Probability
*‚è±Ô∏è Estimated time: 15 minutes*

::: {.problem}
**Problem D1: Advanced Counting with Restrictions**

A restaurant offers a prix fixe menu where customers must choose:

- 1 appetizer from 6 options
  
- 1 main course from 8 options  
  
- 1 dessert from 5 options

However, there are restrictions:

- If you choose the seafood appetizer, you cannot choose the vegetarian main course
  
- If you choose the chocolate dessert, you must choose either the beef or chicken main course (3 of the 8 main courses)

**Part (a):** How many valid meal combinations are possible?

**Part (b):** If customers choose randomly among valid combinations, what is the probability someone chooses the chocolate dessert?
