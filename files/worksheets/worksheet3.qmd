**üìö Key Formulas Reference:**

**Basic Probability:**

- Conditional Probability: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
  
- Bayes' Theorem: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$
  
- Law of Total Probability: $P(A) = \sum P(A|B_i) \cdot P(B_i)$

**Counting:**

- Permutations: $P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$
  
- Combinations: $C(n,r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$

**Discrete Random Variables:**

- Binomial PMF: $P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$
  
- Poisson PMF: $P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$
  
- Expected Value: $E[X] = \sum x \cdot P(X = x)$
  
- Variance: $\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$

**Variance Formulas:**

- Population Variance: $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}$
  
- Sample Variance: $s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$
  
- Variance of Sample Mean: $\text{Var}(\bar{X}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$
  
- Standard Error: $SE(\bar{X}) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

# Section D: Variance Calculations Practice
*‚è±Ô∏è Estimated time: 20 minutes*

## Understanding Variance: Population vs Sample

::: {.formula-box}
**üéØ Key Variance Concepts:**

**Population Variance** (when you have ALL data):
$$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}$$

**Sample Variance** (when you have a sample):
$$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$

**Why (n-1)?** Using the sample mean to estimate deviations "uses up" one degree of freedom.

**Variance of Sample Mean:**
$$\text{Var}(\bar{X}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$$

**Standard Error (Standard Deviation of Sample Mean):**
$$SE(\bar{X}) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

**Problem D1: Basic Variance Calculations (6 points)**

The following data represents the number of customer complaints per day for a small business over 8 days:

**Data:** 3, 7, 2, 8, 5, 6, 4, 9

**Part (a) [1 point]:** Calculate the sample mean $\bar{x}$.

**Part (b) [2 points]:** Calculate the sample variance $s^2$ using the formula with $(n-1)$ in the denominator.

**Part (c) [1 point]:** Calculate the sample standard deviation $s$.

**Part (d) [1 point]:** If this were treated as a complete population, what would the population variance $\sigma^2$ be?

**Part (e) [1 point]:** Explain why we divide by $(n-1)$ for sample variance instead of $n$.

**Problem D2: Sample Mean Distribution (8 points)**

A factory produces bolts with a mean length of 5.0 cm and standard deviation of 0.2 cm. Quality control takes random samples to monitor production.

**Part (a) [1 point]:** If a sample of 16 bolts is taken, what is the expected value of the sample mean $\bar{X}$?

**Part (b) [1.5 points]:** What is the variance of the sample mean $\text{Var}(\bar{X})$?

**Part (c) [1 point]:** What is the standard error of the sample mean?

**Part (d) [1.5 points]:** If the sample size is increased to 64 bolts, how does this change the standard error?

**Part (e) [1.5 points - Conceptual]:** Explain why the variance of the sample mean decreases as sample size increases.

**Part (f) [1.5 points - Application]:** What sample size would be needed to reduce the standard error to 0.025 cm?

A pharmaceutical company tests the effectiveness of a new drug. They measure the reduction in symptoms (in points) for patients taking the drug. Historical data shows that symptom reduction follows a distribution with mean Œº = 12 points and standard deviation œÉ = 4 points.

**Part (a) [1 point]:** If they test the drug on a sample of 25 patients, what is the expected value of the average symptom reduction?

**Part (b) [1.5 points]:** What is the standard error of the sample mean?

**Part (c) [1.5 points]:** The company wants the standard error to be no more than 0.5 points. What minimum sample size is required?

**Part (d) [2 points - Practical Interpretation]:** If the company observes a sample mean of 13.2 points from 25 patients, calculate how many standard errors this is above the expected value. Is this result likely due to random variation?

**Part (e) [1 point - Study Design]:** The company is designing a larger study. If they want to detect a true difference of 1 point from the historical mean with a standard error of 0.3, what sample size should they use?
