**üìö Key Formulas Reference:**

**General Random Variable Properties:**

- **Expected Value:** $E[X] = \sum_{k} k \cdot P(X = k)$
  
- **Variance:** $\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 = \sum_{k} k^2 \cdot P(X = k) - \mu^2$

- **Standard Deviation:** $\sigma = \sqrt{\text{Var}(X)}$

**Discrete Distributions:**

**Bernoulli Distribution:** $X \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$

- **PMF:** $P(X = k) = p^k(1-p)^{1-k}$ for $k \in \{0,1\}$
- **Mean:** $E[X] = p$
- **Variance:** $\text{Var}(X) = p(1-p)$

**Binomial Distribution:** $X \sim \text{Binomial}(n,p)$

- **PMF:** $P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n$
- **Mean:** $E[X] = np$
- **Variance:** $\text{Var}(X) = np(1-p)$

**Geometric Distribution:** $X \sim \text{Geometric}(p)$

- **PMF:** $P(X = k) = (1-p)^{k-1} p$ for $k = 1, 2, 3, ...$
- **Mean:** $E[X] = \frac{1}{p}$
- **Variance:** $\text{Var}(X) = \frac{1-p}{p^2}$

**Poisson Distribution:** $X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)$

- **PMF:** $P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, ...$
- **Mean:** $E[X] = \lambda$
- **Variance:** $\text{Var}(X) = \lambda$

**Problem A1: Distribution Identification**

For each scenario below, identify the appropriate discrete distribution and state the parameter(s). **Do not calculate probabilities yet.**

**(a)** A fair coin is flipped until the first head appears. Let X = number of flips needed.

**(b)** A quality control inspector tests 20 randomly selected items from a production line where 5% are defective. Let X = number of defective items found.

**(c)** A website receives visitors at an average rate of 3 per minute. Let X = number of visitors in a 2-minute period.

**(d)** A basketball player shoots one free throw with an 80% success rate. Let X = 1 if successful, 0 if unsuccessful.

**(e)** A student keeps taking a driving test until they pass. The probability of passing on any attempt is 0.7. Let X = number of attempts needed to pass.

**Problem A2: Probability Mass Function**

The random variable X has the following probability distribution:

| X     | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    |
|-------|------|------|------|------|------|
| P(X=k)| 0.1  | 0.3  | 0.4  | a    | 0.1  |

**(a)** Find the value of $a$.

**(b)** Calculate $P(X \leq 3)$.

**(c)** Calculate $P(X > 2)$.

# Section B: Expected Value and Variance
*‚è±Ô∏è Estimated time: 15 minutes*

::: {.problem}
**Problem B1: Manual Calculations**

Using the probability distribution from Problem A2, calculate:

**(a)** The expected value $E[X]$

**(b)** The variance $\text{Var}(X)$

**(c)** The standard deviation $\sigma$

:::{.callout-tip}
**Calculation Strategy:**

For expected value: $E[X] = \sum k \cdot P(X = k)$

For variance: First find $E[X^2] = \sum k^2 \cdot P(X = k)$, then use $\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$

**Problem B2: Bernoulli and Binomial Applications**

A manufacturing process produces items that are defective with probability 0.15.

**(a)** If you select one item randomly, what is the expected value and variance of X = number of defective items?

**(b)** If you select 25 items randomly, what is the expected number of defective items and the standard deviation?

:::{.callout-tip}
Part (a) is a Bernoulli distribution. Part (b) is a Binomial distribution. Use the formulas from the reference box!

# Section C: Distribution Calculations
*‚è±Ô∏è Estimated time: 12 minutes*

::: {.problem}
**Problem C1: Binomial Distribution**

A multiple-choice quiz has 10 questions, each with 4 choices. A student guesses randomly on all questions.

**(a)** What is the probability the student gets exactly 3 questions correct?

**(b)** What is the probability the student gets at least 2 questions correct?

**(c)** What is the expected number of correct answers?

:::{.callout-tip}
This is binomial with $n = 10$ and $p = 0.25$ (since 1 out of 4 choices is correct).

For part (b): $P(X \geq 2) = 1 - P(X \leq 1) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1)]$

**Problem C2: Poisson Distribution**

A call center receives an average of 4 calls per minute.

**(a)** What is the probability of receiving exactly 6 calls in a given minute?

**(b)** What is the probability of receiving no calls in a given minute?

**(c)** What is the probability of receiving more than 2 calls in a given minute?

# Section D: Advanced Applications
*‚è±Ô∏è Estimated time: 15 minutes*

::: {.problem}
**Problem D1: Geometric Distribution**

A software company releases updates that fix critical bugs with probability 0.6 per update.

**(a)** What is the probability that the first successful bug fix occurs on the 3rd update?

**(b)** What is the expected number of updates needed to get the first successful bug fix?

**(c)** What is the probability that it takes more than 4 updates to get the first successful bug fix?

:::{.callout-tip}
For part (c): $P(X > 4) = P(X \geq 5) = (1-p)^4$ where $p = 0.6$

This represents the probability of 4 consecutive failures.

**Problem D2: Mixed Applications**

A quality assurance team at a pharmaceutical company is testing a new batch of medications.

- Each pill has a 2% chance of being defective
- They test pills one by one until they find the first defective pill
- They also want to know about defects in batches of 50 pills

**(a)** What is the probability that the first defective pill is found on the 5th test?

**(b)** What is the expected number of pills they need to test to find the first defective one?

**(c)** In a batch of 50 pills, what is the probability that exactly 2 pills are defective?

**(d)** In a batch of 50 pills, what is the expected number of defective pills?

:::{.callout-tip}
Parts (a) and (b) use geometric distribution. Parts (c) and (d) use binomial distribution.

Be careful with the parameter $p = 0.02$ for both distributions.
