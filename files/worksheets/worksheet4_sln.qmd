# Section A: Basic Concepts and Identification - SOLUTIONS

## Problem A1: Distribution Identification

**(a)** A fair coin is flipped until the first head appears. Let X = number of flips needed.

**Solution:** **Geometric Distribution** with parameter p = 0.5
- We count the number of trials until first success
- Each flip is independent with constant probability of success

**(b)** A quality control inspector tests 20 randomly selected items from a production line where 5% are defective. Let X = number of defective items found.

**Solution:** **Binomial Distribution** with parameters n = 20, p = 0.05
- Fixed number of trials (20)
- Each item has same probability of being defective (0.05)
- We count number of successes (defective items)

**(c)** A website receives visitors at an average rate of 3 per minute. Let X = number of visitors in a 2-minute period.

**Solution:** **Poisson Distribution** with parameter λ = 6
- Events occurring over time at constant rate
- Rate = 3 per minute × 2 minutes = 6 visitors expected in 2 minutes

**(d)** A basketball player shoots one free throw with an 80% success rate. Let X = 1 if successful, 0 if unsuccessful.

**Solution:** **Bernoulli Distribution** with parameter p = 0.8
- Single trial with two outcomes (success/failure)

**(e)** A student keeps taking a driving test until they pass. The probability of passing on any attempt is 0.7. Let X = number of attempts needed to pass.

**Solution:** **Geometric Distribution** with parameter p = 0.7
- We count trials until first success (passing)

## Problem A2: Probability Mass Function

Given distribution:
| X     | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    |
|-------|------|------|------|------|------|
| P(X=k)| 0.1  | 0.3  | 0.4  | a    | 0.1  |

**(a)** Find the value of $a$.

**Solution:**
Since probabilities must sum to 1:
0.1 + 0.3 + 0.4 + a + 0.1 = 1
0.9 + a = 1
**a = 0.1**

**(b)** Calculate $P(X \leq 3)$.

**Solution:**
P(X ≤ 3) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3)
P(X ≤ 3) = 0.1 + 0.3 + 0.4 = **0.8**

**(c)** Calculate $P(X > 2)$.

**Solution:**
P(X > 2) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5)
P(X > 2) = 0.4 + 0.1 + 0.1 = **0.6**

# Section B: Expected Value and Variance - SOLUTIONS

## Problem B1: Manual Calculations

Using the distribution from Problem A2:
| X     | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    |
|-------|------|------|------|------|------|
| P(X=k)| 0.1  | 0.3  | 0.4  | 0.1  | 0.1  |

**(a)** The expected value $E[X]$

**Solution:**
E[X] = Σ k · P(X = k)
E[X] = 1(0.1) + 2(0.3) + 3(0.4) + 4(0.1) + 5(0.1)
E[X] = 0.1 + 0.6 + 1.2 + 0.4 + 0.5
**E[X] = 2.8**

**(b)** The variance $\text{Var}(X)$

**Solution:**
First, calculate E[X²]:
E[X²] = Σ k² · P(X = k)
E[X²] = 1²(0.1) + 2²(0.3) + 3²(0.4) + 4²(0.1) + 5²(0.1)
E[X²] = 1(0.1) + 4(0.3) + 9(0.4) + 16(0.1) + 25(0.1)
E[X²] = 0.1 + 1.2 + 3.6 + 1.6 + 2.5 = 9.0

Then: Var(X) = E[X²] - (E[X])²
Var(X) = 9.0 - (2.8)²
Var(X) = 9.0 - 7.84
**Var(X) = 1.16**

**(c)** The standard deviation $\sigma$

**Solution:**
σ = √Var(X) = √1.16 = **1.0770**

## Problem B2: Bernoulli and Binomial Applications

Manufacturing process with 15% defect rate.

**(a)** If you select one item randomly, what is the expected value and variance of X = number of defective items?

**Solution:**
This is Bernoulli(p = 0.15)
- **E[X] = p = 0.15**
- **Var(X) = p(1-p) = 0.15(0.85) = 0.1275**

**(b)** If you select 25 items randomly, what is the expected number of defective items and the standard deviation?

**Solution:**
This is Binomial(n = 25, p = 0.15)
- **E[X] = np = 25(0.15) = 3.75**
- Var(X) = np(1-p) = 25(0.15)(0.85) = 3.1875
- **σ = √3.1875 = 1.7854**

# Section C: Distribution Calculations - SOLUTIONS

## Problem C1: Binomial Distribution

Quiz: 10 questions, 4 choices each, student guesses randomly.
This is Binomial(n = 10, p = 0.25)

**(a)** What is the probability the student gets exactly 3 questions correct?

**Solution:**
P(X = 3) = C(10,3) × (0.25)³ × (0.75)⁷
P(X = 3) = 120 × 0.015625 × 0.1335
**P(X = 3) = 0.2503**

**(b)** What is the probability the student gets at least 2 questions correct?

**Solution:**
P(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X ≤ 1) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1)]

P(X = 0) = C(10,0) × (0.25)⁰ × (0.75)¹⁰ = 1 × 1 × 0.0563 = 0.0563
P(X = 1) = C(10,1) × (0.25)¹ × (0.75)⁹ = 10 × 0.25 × 0.0751 = 0.1877

P(X ≥ 2) = 1 - (0.0563 + 0.1877) = 1 - 0.2440
**P(X ≥ 2) = 0.7560**

**(c)** What is the expected number of correct answers?

**Solution:**
E[X] = np = 10 × 0.25 = **2.5**

## Problem C2: Poisson Distribution

Call center: λ = 4 calls per minute
This is Poisson(λ = 4)

**(a)** What is the probability of receiving exactly 6 calls in a given minute?

**Solution:**
P(X = 6) = (λ⁶ × e^(-λ))/6! = (4⁶ × e^(-4))/6!
P(X = 6) = (4096 × 0.0183)/720 = 0.1042
**P(X = 6) = 0.1042**

**(b)** What is the probability of receiving no calls in a given minute?

**Solution:**
P(X = 0) = (λ⁰ × e^(-λ))/0! = (1 × e^(-4))/1 = e^(-4)
**P(X = 0) = 0.0183**

**(c)** What is the probability of receiving more than 2 calls in a given minute?

**Solution:**
P(X > 2) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)]

P(X = 0) = e^(-4) = 0.0183
P(X = 1) = (4¹ × e^(-4))/1! = 4 × 0.0183 = 0.0733
P(X = 2) = (4² × e^(-4))/2! = 16 × 0.0183/2 = 0.1465

P(X > 2) = 1 - (0.0183 + 0.0733 + 0.1465) = 1 - 0.2381
**P(X > 2) = 0.7619**

# Section D: Advanced Applications - SOLUTIONS

## Problem D1: Geometric Distribution

Software updates: p = 0.6 success rate
This is Geometric(p = 0.6)

**(a)** What is the probability that the first successful bug fix occurs on the 3rd update?

**Solution:**
P(X = 3) = (1-p)^(k-1) × p = (0.4)² × 0.6
P(X = 3) = 0.16 × 0.6 = **0.0960**

**(b)** What is the expected number of updates needed to get the first successful bug fix?

**Solution:**
E[X] = 1/p = 1/0.6 = **1.6667**

**(c)** What is the probability that it takes more than 4 updates to get the first successful bug fix?

**Solution:**
P(X > 4) = (1-p)⁴ = (0.4)⁴ = **0.0256**

## Problem D2: Mixed Applications

Pharmaceutical testing: p = 0.02 defect rate

**(a)** What is the probability that the first defective pill is found on the 5th test?

**Solution:** Geometric(p = 0.02)
P(X = 5) = (1-p)^(k-1) × p = (0.98)⁴ × 0.02
P(X = 5) = 0.9224 × 0.02 = **0.0184**

**(b)** What is the expected number of pills they need to test to find the first defective one?

**Solution:** Geometric(p = 0.02)
E[X] = 1/p = 1/0.02 = **50**

**(c)** In a batch of 50 pills, what is the probability that exactly 2 pills are defective?

**Solution:** Binomial(n = 50, p = 0.02)
P(X = 2) = C(50,2) × (0.02)² × (0.98)⁴⁸
P(X = 2) = 1225 × 0.0004 × 0.3773 = **0.1849**

**(d)** In a batch of 50 pills, what is the expected number of defective pills?

**Solution:** Binomial(n = 50, p = 0.02)
E[X] = np = 50 × 0.02 = **1**

# Section E: Reflection Questions - SOLUTIONS

**(a)** Explain the key difference between a Binomial distribution and a Geometric distribution in terms of what they count.

**Solution:**
- **Binomial** counts the **number of successes** in a **fixed number** of trials
- **Geometric** counts the **number of trials needed** to get the **first success**

**(b)** When would you use a Poisson distribution instead of a Binomial distribution?

**Solution:**
Use Poisson when:
- Events occur over **time or space** at a constant rate
- The number of possible events is **very large** but the probability of each is **very small**
- We don't have a fixed number of trials
- Examples: arrivals, defects per unit area, accidents per day

**(c)** If $X \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p)$, under what conditions would the variance be maximized?

**Solution:**
Variance = np(1-p)
For fixed n, variance is maximized when p(1-p) is maximized.
Taking the derivative: d/dp[p(1-p)] = 1-2p = 0
This gives **p = 0.5**
The variance is maximized when p = 0.5 (fair coin scenario).
