# Section A: Probability - SOLUTIONS
*⏱️ Estimated time: 8 minutes*

::: {.problem}
**Problem A1: Probability Distributions - SOLUTION**

For a valid probability distribution, two conditions must be met:

1. All probabilities must be non-negative (≥ 0)
   
2. The sum of all probabilities must equal 1

**Analysis:**

**(a) Invalid** 

- Sum = 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 1.2 > 1
The probabilities sum to more than 1, violating the second condition.

**(b) Valid** 

- Sum = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
All probabilities are non-negative and sum to 1. This represents a class where everyone receives a C.

**(c) Invalid** 

- Sum = 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0 + 0 = 0.9 < 1
The probabilities sum to less than 1, violating the second condition.

**(d) Invalid** 

- Contains F = -0.1 < 0
Although the sum would equal 1.0, the probability for grade F is negative, violating the first condition.

**(e) Valid** 

- Sum = 0.2 + 0.4 + 0.2 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 1.0
All probabilities are non-negative and sum to 1.

**(f) Invalid** 

- Contains B = -0.1 < 0
Although the sum equals 1.0, the probability for grade B is negative, violating the first condition.

# Section B: Permutations and Combinations - SOLUTIONS

**Problem B1: Permutations and Combinations - SOLUTION**

**Part (a):** How many 6-character passwords can be formed using 3 specific letters and 3 specific digits if repetitions are not allowed and letters must come before digits?

**Solution:**
Since letters must come before digits, we have a fixed structure: LLL DDD

- Step 1: Arrange 3 letters in the first 3 positions
  - This is a permutation: P(3,3) = 3! = 6 ways

- Step 2: Arrange 3 digits in the last 3 positions  
  - This is a permutation: P(3,3) = 3! = 6 ways

- Step 3: Apply multiplication principle
  - Total passwords = 6 × 6 = **36 passwords**

**Part (b):** If the team wants to select 4 people from 12 employees to form a security committee where order doesn't matter, how many ways can this be done?

**Solution:**
Since order doesn't matter, this is a combination problem.

$$C(12,4) = \binom{12}{4} = \frac{12!}{4!(12-4)!} = \frac{12!}{4! \cdot 8!}$$

$$= \frac{12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{11880}{24} = \textbf{495 ways}$$

# Section C: Conditional Probability - SOLUTIONS
*⏱️ Estimated time: 15 minutes*

**Problem B1: Conditional Probability and Medical Testing - SOLUTION**

**Given Information:**

- P(has variant) = 0.03
  
- P(test positive | has variant) = 0.95 (sensitivity)
  
- P(test negative | no variant) = 0.92 (specificity)
  
- Therefore: P(test positive | no variant) = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08

**Part (a):** What is the probability that a randomly selected person tests positive?

**Solution:**

Using the Law of Total Probability:

$$P(\text{test positive}) = P(\text{test positive | has variant}) \times P(\text{has variant}) + P(\text{test positive | no variant}) \times P(\text{no variant})$$

$$P(\text{test positive}) = 0.95 \times 0.03 + 0.08 \times 0.97$$
$$= 0.0285 + 0.0776 = \textbf{0.1061}$$

**Part (b):** If someone tests positive, what is the probability they actually have the variant?

**Solution:**
Using Bayes' Theorem:

$$P(\text{has variant | test positive}) = \frac{P(\text{test positive | has variant}) \times P(\text{has variant})}{P(\text{test positive})}$$

$$= \frac{0.95 \times 0.03}{0.1061} = \frac{0.0285}{0.1061} = \textbf{0.2686}$$

**Part (c):** If someone tests negative, what is the probability they actually don't have the variant?

**Solution:**
First, find P(test negative):
$$P(\text{test negative}) = 1 - P(\text{test positive}) = 1 - 0.1061 = 0.8939$$

Using Bayes' Theorem:
$$P(\text{no variant | test negative}) = \frac{P(\text{test negative | no variant}) \times P(\text{no variant})}{P(\text{test negative})}$$

$$= \frac{0.92 \times 0.97}{0.8939} = \frac{0.8924}{0.8939} = \textbf{0.9983}$$

**Part (d) [Challenge]:** Two consecutive positive tests - what is the probability they actually have the variant?

**Solution:**
Assuming independence between tests:

$$P(\text{two positive | has variant}) = 0.95^2 = 0.9025$$
$$P(\text{two positive | no variant}) = 0.08^2 = 0.0064$$

$$P(\text{two positive}) = 0.9025 \times 0.03 + 0.0064 \times 0.97 = 0.027075 + 0.006208 = 0.033283$$

$$P(\text{has variant | two positive}) = \frac{0.027075}{0.033283} = \textbf{0.8134}$$

**Problem C1: Advanced Counting with Restrictions - SOLUTION**

**Part (a):** How many valid meal combinations are possible?

**Solution:**
We need to consider cases based on the restrictions.

**Case 1: Seafood appetizer is chosen**

- 1 appetizer option (seafood)
  
- 7 main course options (cannot choose vegetarian)
  
- 5 dessert options
  
- Combinations: 1 × 7 × 5 = 35

**Case 2: Non-seafood appetizer + chocolate dessert**

- 5 appetizer options (non-seafood)
  
- 3 main course options (only beef or chicken allowed with chocolate)
  
- 1 dessert option (chocolate)
  
- Combinations: 5 × 3 × 1 = 15

**Case 3: Non-seafood appetizer + non-chocolate dessert**
- 5 appetizer options (non-seafood)
  
- 8 main course options (no restrictions)
  
- 4 dessert options (non-chocolate)
  
- Combinations: 5 × 8 × 4 = 160

**Total valid combinations:** 35 + 15 + 160 = **210 combinations**

**Part (b):** If customers choose randomly among valid combinations, what is the probability someone chooses the chocolate dessert?

**Solution:**
Combinations with chocolate dessert: 15 (from Case 2 above)
Total valid combinations: 210

$$P(\text{chocolate dessert}) = \frac{15}{210} = \frac{1}{14} = \textbf{0.0714}$$

**Problem B3: Daily Expenses - SOLUTION**

**Given:**

- Coffee: Mean = $1.40, SD = $0.30
  
- Muffin: Mean = $2.50, SD = $0.15
  
- Prices are independent

**Part (a):** What is the mean and standard deviation of the amount she spends on breakfast daily?

**Solution:**
For the sum of independent random variables:

**Mean of daily expenses:**
$$E[\text{Daily}] = E[\text{Coffee}] + E[\text{Muffin}] = \$1.40 + \$2.50 = \textbf{\$3.90}$$

**Variance of daily expenses:**
$$\text{Var}[\text{Daily}] = \text{Var}[\text{Coffee}] + \text{Var}[\text{Muffin}] = (0.30)^2 + (0.15)^2 = 0.09 + 0.0225 = 0.1125$$

**Standard deviation of daily expenses:**
$$SD[\text{Daily}] = \sqrt{0.1125} = \textbf{\$0.3354}$$

**Part (b):** What is the mean and standard deviation of the amount she spends on breakfast weekly (7 days)?

**Solution:**
For the sum of 7 independent daily expenses:

**Mean of weekly expenses:**
$$E[\text{Weekly}] = 7 \times E[\text{Daily}] = 7 \times \$3.90 = \textbf{\$27.30}$$

**Variance of weekly expenses:**
$$\text{Var}[\text{Weekly}] = 7 \times \text{Var}[\text{Daily}] = 7 \times 0.1125 = 0.7875$$

**Standard deviation of weekly expenses:**
$$SD[\text{Weekly}] = \sqrt{0.7875} = \textbf{\$0.8874}$$
