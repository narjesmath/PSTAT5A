**üìö Key Formulas Reference:**

**Basic Probability:**

- **Conditional Probability:** $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
  
- **Bayes' Theorem:** $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$
  
- **Law of Total Probability:** $P(A) = \sum P(A|B_i) \cdot P(B_i)$

- **Addition Rule:** $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$

- **Multiplication Rule:** $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B|A) = P(B) \cdot P(A|B)$

**Counting:**

- **Permutations:** $P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$
  
- **Combinations:** $C(n,r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$

**Problem A1: Probability Distributions**

Each row in the table below is a proposed grade distribution for a class. Identify each as a valid or invalid probability distribution, and explain your reasoning.

| Class | A   | B   | C   | D   | F    |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|
| (a)   | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.1  |
| (b)   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0    |
| (c)   | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0   | 0    |
| (d)   | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.1 | -0.1 |
| (e)   | 0.2 | 0.4 | 0.2 | 0.1 | 0.1  |
| (f)   | 0   | -0.1| 1.1 | 0   | 0    |

# Section B: Permutations and Combination
*‚è±Ô∏è Estimated time: 15 minutes*

**Problem B1: Permutations and Combinations**

A cybersecurity team needs to create a secure access protocol.

**Part (a):** How many 6-character passwords can be formed using 3 specific letters and 3 specific digits if repetitions are not allowed and letters must come before digits?

:::{.callout-tip}
Since letters must come before digits, think of this as two separate arrangement problems:

- First, arrange the 3 letters in the first 3 positions
  
- Then, arrange the 3 digits in the last 3 positions
  
- Use the multiplication principle to combine these results
:::



**Part (b):** If the team wants to select 4 people from 12 employees to form a security committee where order doesn't matter, how many ways can this be done?

:::{.callout-tip}
Since order doesn't matter, this is a combination problem. Ask yourself:

- Are we arranging people in specific positions, or just selecting a group?
  
- Which formula should you use: $P(n,r)$ or $C(n,r)$?

# Section C: Conditional Probability
*‚è±Ô∏è Estimated time: 15 minutes*

::: {.problem}
**Problem B1: Conditional Probability and Medical Testing**

A new COVID variant test has the following characteristics:

- The variant affects 3% of the tested population
  
- The test correctly identifies 95% of people with the variant (sensitivity)
  
- The test correctly identifies 92% of people without the variant (specificity)

**Part (a):** What is the probability that a randomly selected person tests positive?

**Part (b):** If someone tests positive, what is the probability they actually have the variant?

**Part (c):** If someone tests negative, what is the probability they actually don't have the variant?

**Part (d) [Challenge]:** The health department wants to reduce false positives. They decide to require two consecutive positive tests for a positive diagnosis. Assuming test results are independent, what is the new probability that someone with two positive tests actually has the variant?

# Section C: Conditional Probability
*‚è±Ô∏è Estimated time: 15 minutes*

::: {.problem}
**Problem C1: Advanced Counting with Restrictions**

A restaurant offers a prix fixe menu where customers must choose:

- 1 appetizer from 6 options
  
- 1 main course from 8 options  
  
- 1 dessert from 5 options

However, there are restrictions:

- If you choose the seafood appetizer, you cannot choose the vegetarian main course
  
- If you choose the chocolate dessert, you must choose either the beef or chicken main course (3 of the 8 main courses)

**Part (a):** How many valid meal combinations are possible?

**Part (b):** If customers choose randomly among valid combinations, what is the probability someone chooses the chocolate dessert?

**Problem B3: Daily Expenses**

Sally gets a cup of coffee and a muffin every day for breakfast from one of the many coffee shops in her neighborhood. She picks a coffee shop each morning at random and independently of previous days. The average price of a cup of coffee is $1.40 with a standard deviation of 30¬¢ ($0.30), the average price of a muffin is $2.50 with a standard deviation of 15¬¢, and the two prices are independent of each other.

**Part (a):** What is the mean and standard deviation of the amount she spends on breakfast daily?

**Part (b):** What is the mean and standard deviation of the amount she spends on breakfast weekly (7 days)?
