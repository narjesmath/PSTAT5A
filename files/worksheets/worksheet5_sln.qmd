# Section A Solutions: Continuous Random Variables

::: {.solution}
**Solution A1: Distribution Identification and Properties**

**(a) Exponential Distribution**

Since the average time between arrivals is $2$ minutes, we have:

- **Parameter $\lambda$:** The rate parameter $\lambda = \frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5$ arrivals per minute

- **Probability calculation:** $P(X ≤ 1)$ where $X \sim Exponential(0.5)$
  
  For exponential distribution: $P(X ≤ x) = 1 - e^{(- \lambda x)}$
  
  $P(X ≤ 1) = 1 - e^{(-0.5×1)} = 1 - e^{(-0.5)} = 1 - 0.6065 = \boxed{0.3935}$

**(b) Uniform Distribution**

- **Parameters:** $a = 10, b = 30$

- **Expected Value:** $E[X] = (a + b)/2 = \frac{(10 + 30)}{2} = \boxed{20}$

- **Variance:** $Var(X) = \frac{(b - a)^2}{12} = \frac{(30 - 10)^2}{12} = \frac{400}{12} = \boxed{33.3333}$

**Solution A2: Normal Distribution Calculations**

Given: $X \sim N(64, 2.5^2)$

**(a) $P(X > 67)$**

**Step 1: Standardize**

$Z = (67 - 64)/2.5 = 3/2.5 = 1.2$

**Step 2: Find probability**

$P(X > 67) = P(Z > 1.2) = 1 - P(Z ≤ 1.2) = 1 - 0.8849 = \boxed{0.1151}$

**(b) 25th percentile**

Step 1: Find $z$-value for $25$ -th percentile

$P(Z ≤ z) = 0.25$, so $z_{0.25} = -0.6745$

Step 2: Convert back to $X$

$x = \mu + z \sigma = 64 + (-0.6745)(2.5) = 64 - 1.6863 = \boxed{62.3137} \quad \text{inches}$

**(c) P(62 < X < 68)**

Step 1: Standardize both values

$Z_1 = (62 - 64)/2.5 = -0.8$
$Z_2 = (68 - 64)/2.5 = 1.6$

Step 2: Find probability

$P(62 < X < 68) = P(-0.8 < Z < 1.6) = P(Z < 1.6) - P(Z < -0.8)$

$= 0.9452 - 0.2119 = \boxed{0.7333}$

# Section B Solutions: Confidence Intervals

::: {.solution}
**Solution B1: Understanding Confidence Intervals**

**(a) Explanation of $95\%$ Confidence Interval:**

A $95\%$ confidence interval means that if we were to repeat our sampling process many times (say $100$ times) and construct a confidence interval each time using the same method, approximately $95$ of those intervals would contain the true population mean. **It does NOT mean there's a $95\%$ probability that the population mean lies in any one specific interval.**

**(b) Sample mean and margin of error:**

Given $CI$: ($150g, 170g$)

- **Sample mean:** $\bar x = (150 + 170)/2 = \boxed{160g}$
  
- **Margin of error:** $E = (170 - 150)/2 = \boxed{10g}$

**(c) True or False statement:**

**FALSE.** Once we calculate a specific confidence interval, the population mean either is or isn't in that interval, there's no probability involved for that specific interval. The $95\%$ refers to the long-run success rate of the method, not the probability for any individual interval.

**Solution B2: Constructing Confidence Intervals**

Given: $n = 36, \bar x = 78.5, s = 12$

**(a) 95% Confidence Interval:**

Step 1: Check conditions

- $n = 36 ≥ 30$, so we can use $z$-distribution
- For $95% CI: z{0.025} = 1.96$

Step 2: Calculate margin of error

$E = z_{0.025} × (\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}) = 1.96 × (\frac{12}{\sqrt{36}}) = 1.96 × (\frac{12}{6}) = 1.96 × 2 = 3.92$

Step 3: Construct interval

$CI = \bar x ± E = 78.5 ± 3.92 = \boxed{(74.58, 82.42)}$

**(b) Interpretation:**

We are $95\%$ confident that the true population mean test score is between $74.58$ and $82.42$ points.

**(c) Effects on interval width:**

- **Increasing confidence level to 99%:** The interval would become **wider** because we need $z_{0.005} = 2.576 > 1.96$

- **Increasing sample size to 144:** The interval would become **narrower** because the margin of error would be $E = 1.96 × (\frac{12}{\sqrt{144}}) = 1.96 × 1 = 1.96$ (smaller than $3.92$)

:::

::: {.solution}
**Solution B3: Sample Size Determination**

Given: $E = \$5$, confidence = $95\%, \sigma = \$25$

**(a) Required sample size:**

Step 1: Use sample size formula

$n = (z_{0.025} × \frac{\sigma}{E})^2$

Step 2: Substitute values

$n = (1.96 × 25 / 5)^2 = (49/5)^2 = 9.8^2 = 96.04$

Step 3: Round up

$\boxed{n = 97}$ customers (**always round up for sample size**)

**(b) For margin of error = $3:**

$n = (1.96 × 25 / 3)^2 = (49/3)^2 = 16.333^2 = 266.67$

$\boxed{n = 267}$ customers

# Optional Problem Solutions

::: {.solution}
**Optional Solution 1: Conceptual Understanding**

**(a) Differences between discrete and continuous:**

**Values they can take:**

- Discrete: Countable values (integers, specific points)
  
- Continuous: Uncountably infinite values (any real number in an interval)

**How we calculate probabilities:**

- Discrete: $P(X = x)$ can be non-zero; we sum probabilities
  
- Continuous: $P(X = x) = 0$ for any specific $x$; we integrate over intervals

**(b) Why $P(X = x) = 0$ for continuous distributions:**

In continuous distributions, there are infinitely many possible values in any interval. The probability of hitting any one exact value is infinitesimally small, hence zero. We instead calculate $P(a < X < b)$ by integrating the PDF over the interval $[a,b]$.

**(c) Relationship between PDF and CDF:**

- **PDF (f(x)):** The probability density function gives the "density" of probability at each point
  
- **CDF (F(x)):** The cumulative distribution function gives $P(X ≤ x)$
  
- **Relationship:** $F(x) = \int_{-∞}^x f(t)dt,\quad  \text{and} \quad f(x) = F'(x)$

::: {.important}
**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Always standardize** normal distribution problems using $Z = \frac{(X - μ)}{\sigma}$
   
2. **Interpret confidence intervals** in context, they're about the method's reliability, not individual interval probabilities
   
3. **Choose the right distribution**  use $t$ when $\sigma$ is unknown and $n < 30$
   
4. **Round up sample sizes** to ensure you meet the margin of error requirement
   
5. **For continuous distributions**, focus on intervals, not individual points
