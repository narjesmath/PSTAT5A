# Descriptive Statistics

::: {.formula-box}
**Sample Mean:**  
$$\bar x = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}$$
**Population Mean:**  
$$\mu = \frac{\sum x_i}{N}$$
:::

::: {.formula-box}
**Population Variance:**  
$$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}$$
**Sample Variance:**  
$$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$
:::

::: {.formula-box}
**Sample Standard Deviation:**  
$$s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar x)^2}{n-1}}$$
**Population Standard Deviation:**  
$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}}$$
:::

::: {.formula-box}
**Percentile:** Value below which a certain percentage of data falls  
**Quartiles:** Q1 (25th percentile), Q2 = Median (50th percentile), Q3 (75th percentile)  
**Interquartile Range (IQR):** $Q_3 - Q_1$  
**Range:** Maximum - Minimum
:::

::: {.formula-box}
**Distribution Shapes:**
- Symmetric: Mean $\approx$ Median
- Right-skewed: Mean $>$ Median (tail extends to the right)
- Left-skewed: Mean $<$ Median (tail extends to the left)
- Outliers affect the mean more than the median

# Probability Rules

## Basic Probability Concepts

::: {.formula-box}
**Probability Definition:**
$$P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}$$

**Properties:**
- $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$
- $P(\emptyset) = 0$ (impossible event)
- $P(S) = 1$ (certain event, where $S$ is sample space)
:::

::: {.example}
**Example:** Rolling a fair die, probability of getting an even number:  
$$P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$
:::

::: {.practice}
**Practice:** What is the probability of drawing a face card from a standard deck?  
**Answer:** $P(\text{face card}) = \frac{12}{52} = \frac{3}{13}$
:::

## Complement Rule

::: {.formula-box}
**Formula:**
$$P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$$
Alternative notation: $P(A') = 1 - P(A)$
:::

**Explanation:** The probability that event $A$ does not occur.

::: {.example}
If the probability that Anya will graduate is 0.9, then the probability she will not graduate is:  
$$P(\text{not graduate}) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1$$
:::

::: {.practice}
If $P(\text{rain}) = 0.3$, what is $P(\text{no rain})$?  
**Answer:** $P(\text{no rain}) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$
:::

## Addition Rules

### General Addition Rule (For Any Two Events)

::: {.formula-box}
**Formula:**
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$
:::

**Explanation:** We subtract $P(A \cap B)$ to avoid double-counting the overlap.

::: {.example}
In a class of 24 students, 10 are girls, 11 are A students, and 6 are girls who are A students.  
Probability of selecting a girl or an A student:  
$$P(\text{girl or A}) = \frac{10}{24} + \frac{11}{24} - \frac{6}{24} = \frac{15}{24} = 0.625$$
:::

### Addition Rule for Mutually Exclusive Events

::: {.formula-box}
**Formula:**
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$
Condition: $P(A \cap B) = 0$ (events cannot occur simultaneously)
:::

::: {.example}
Probability of rolling a 2 or 6 on a die:  
$$P(2 \text{ or } 6) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = 0.333$$
:::

::: {.practice}
A bag contains 4 red, 3 blue, and 2 green marbles. What's the probability of drawing a red or green marble?  
**Answer:** $P(\text{red or green}) = \frac{4}{9} + \frac{2}{9} = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}$
:::

## Multiplication Rules

### Multiplication Rule for Dependent Events

::: {.formula-box}
**Formula:**
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)$$
Alternative: $P(A \cap B) = P(B) \times P(A|B)$
:::

::: {.example}
Drawing two red cards without replacement from a standard deck:  
$$P(\text{red and red}) = \frac{26}{52} \times \frac{25}{51} = 0.245$$
:::

### Multiplication Rule for Independent Events

::: {.formula-box}
**Formula:**
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$$
Condition: Events are independent if $P(A|B) = P(A)$
:::

::: {.example}
Drawing two red cards with replacement:  
$$P(\text{red and red}) = \frac{26}{52} \times \frac{26}{52} = 0.25$$
:::

::: {.practice}
Two fair coins are flipped. What's the probability of getting two heads?  
**Answer:** $P(HH) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$
:::

## Conditional Probability

::: {.formula-box}
**Formula:**
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$
Condition: $P(B) > 0$
:::

**Explanation:** The probability of event $A$ occurring given that event $B$ has occurred.

::: {.example}
In a group of 100 people, 60 are employed and 40 are unemployed. Of the employed, 45 are satisfied with their job.  
What's the probability someone is satisfied given they are employed?  
$$P(\text{satisfied} | \text{employed}) = \frac{45}{60} = 0.75$$
:::

::: {.practice}
A card is drawn from a deck. Given that it's red, what's the probability it's a heart?  
**Answer:** $P(\text{heart} | \text{red}) = \frac{13}{26} = \frac{1}{2}$
:::

## Set Operations and Probability

::: {.formula-box}
**Union (OR):**
- Symbol: $A \cup B$
- Meaning: Event $A$ OR event $B$ (or both) occurs
- Formula: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
:::

::: {.formula-box}
**Intersection (AND):**
- Symbol: $A \cap B$
- Meaning: Both events $A$ AND $B$ occur
- Formula: $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)$
:::

::: {.formula-box}
**Complement (NOT):**
- Symbol: $A^c$ or $A'$
- Meaning: Event $A$ does NOT occur
- Formula: $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$
